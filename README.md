### Projects ☘️
#### Ethical Hacking Course — Course by Internshala
This was an 8-week course, under which we learnt from the modules and performed real-life web-based hacking on the sample websites given to us by Internshala as part of their hacking lab. In the end, we were given a test and a problem statement in which we had to report the vulnerabilities of a website given to us and make a project report mentioning the damage that it could cause. After the completion, we were awarded a certificate. 

#### DVWA - Ethical Hacking
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment and help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications. I worked on this web application, found its vulnerabilities and their exploitability, and then made a project report explaining my findings. 

I hope you'll like my projects 😃
