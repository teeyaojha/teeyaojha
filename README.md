### Projects ☘️
#### Ethical Hacking Course — Course by Internshala
This was an 8-week course, under which we learnt from the modules and performed real-life web-based hacking on the sample websites given to us by Internshala as part of their hacking lab. In the end, we were given a test and a problem statement in which we had to report the vulnerabilities of a website given to us and make a project report mentioning the damage that it could cause. After the completion, we were awarded a certificate. 

#### DVWA - Ethical Hacking
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment and help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications. I worked on this web application, found its vulnerabilities and their exploitability, and then made a project report explaining my findings. 

#### Myntra: Gen Z Fashion Engagement Hub
This project, developed for the Myntra Hackathon, aims to build engagement constructs on a fashion platform to drive connection and virality among younger audiences, particularly Gen Z. By incorporating eco-friendly initiatives, exploring diverse fashion aesthetics, providing informative content, and offering interactive features, we seek to create a habit-forming experience that keeps users returning to the app. Our solution leverages sustainability and the unique fashion preferences of Gen Z to enhance user engagement and foster a vibrant, connected community. The technologies used are mainly HTML, CSS and javascript. 

#### Ice creme website
As a passionate web developer, I made an exciting project that showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project revolves around creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website for an imaginary ice cream brand called "Meowtastic Ice Creams" Leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design, I meticulously designed a navigation bar, incorporated a stylish background pattern, and utilized Google Fonts for an eye-catching typography. Notably, I implemented a client-side email form for user engagement. Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering a delightful online experience. The project not only serves as a testament to my technical skills but also highlights my creativity in combining aesthetics with functionality.

I hope you'll like my projects 😃
